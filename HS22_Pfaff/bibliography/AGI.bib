	abstract = {OSMnx is a Python package for downloading OpenStreetMap street network data and then constructing it into NetworkX graphs. OSMnx can simplify and correct the network’s topology automatically to ensure that nodes actually exclusively represent intersections and dead-ends. Once the network is constructed and corrected, OSMnx can calculate shortest paths from one node to another. It can also calculate various network measures relevant to urban design and transportation (Ewing and Cervero 2010) as well as statistical physics (Newman 2010; Barthélemy 2011), including intersection density, average intersection degree, edge density, average street segment length, circuity (Giacomin and Levinson 2015), clustering coeﬃcients, betweenness centrality (Crucitti, Latora, and Porta 2006), closeness centrality, PageRank (Brin and Page 1998), and many more. Its built-in visualization capabilities leverage matplotlib to easily plot routes (Figure 1), one-way streets, dead-ends, high/low connectivity intersections, and ﬁgure-ground diagrams of street networks and urban form (Figure 2).},

The results of a randomized controlled survey that we administered suggest that access to private charging infrastructure may become a factor inﬂuencing people’s willingness to purchase EVs in the coming years, potentially an important factor. People who own their parking space, and for whom private charging access is unproblematic, were almost twice as likely to indicate a high willingness to purchase an EV as those who park their car on the street, and 50\% more likely than those who park their car in a shared lot or garage. For those parking on the street, suggesting that chargers would be installed free of charge resulted in these people being equally likely as parking space owners to indicate a high willingness to purchase an EV. For those people parking in a shared lot or garage, this suggestion had a more moderate eﬀect.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles are often said to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the results of current comparisons with conventional vehicles are not always in favor of electric vehicles. We outline that this is not only due to the different assumptions in the time of charging and the country-speciﬁc electricity generation mix, but also due to the applied assessment method. We, therefore, discuss four assessment methods (average annual electricity mix, average time-dependent electricity mix, marginal electricity mix, and balancing zero emissions) and analyze the corresponding CO2 emissions for Germany in 2030 using an optimizing energy system model (PERSEUS-NET-TS). Furthermore, we distinguish between an uncontrolled (i.e. direct) charging and an optimized controlled charging strategy. For Germany, the different assessment methods lead to substantial discrepancies in CO2 emissions for 2030 ranging from no emissions to about 0.55 kg/ kWhel (110 g / km). These emissions partly exceed the emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles. Furthermore, depending on the underlying power plant portfolio and the controlling objective, controlled charging might help to reduce CO2 emissions and relieve the electricity grid. We therefore recommend to support controlled charging, to develop consistent methodologies to address key factors affecting CO2 emissions by electric vehicles, and to implement efﬁcient policy instruments which guarantee emission free mobility with electric vehicles agreed upon by researchers and policy makers.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a literature review of studies that investigate infrastructure needs to support the market introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more eﬀort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not suﬃciently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research.},

	abstract = {Plug-In electric vehicles (PEV) are in an early market phase in almost all markets. Still, the lack of public charging infrastructure is a barrier to PEV adoption. The assessment of future charging infrastructure needs is often based on key figures, mainly the ratio of PEV to public charging points. However, countries differ regarding their framework conditions, e.g. the availability of home charging, and the question of how much public charging infrastructure is needed cannot be answered equally for all countries. Yet, studies analyzing the framework conditions for the medium- to long-term demand for charging infrastructure are rare. Here, we review the existing literature and summarize the evidence for the importance of framework conditions on charging infrastructure needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the literature evidence by comparing the framework conditions for charging infrastructure in different countries based on a comprehensive dataset of framework parameters. We find public charging infrastructure as alternative to home charging is only needed in some densely populated areas. However, framework conditions vary largely among countries. Accordingly, findings from literature for specific countries can only be transferred to other countries to a limited extent.},

	abstract = {The idea of electrified transportation is envisioned to be a promising approach to alleviate the issue of climate change. However, a cost-effective commercialization and wide acceptance of electrified transportation necessitates the development of an economical, reliable, and fast charging infrastructure. The incorporation of a well-defined electric vehicle (EV) fast charging infrastructure in the smart grid can offer numerous potential opportunities, particularly from the perspective of vehicle to grid (V2G) technology as well as a solution to the renewable energy intermittency issue. This work reviews the state-of-the-art technology for fast charging of electric vehicles with a comprehensive coverage of the research work done related to the challenges and road blocks to be encountered in its implementation. A comparison of conductive and inductive charging systems is presented followed by an overview of the charging standards and a discussion on the topologies presented in the literature for fast charging stations. A detailed account is presented concerning the issues and opportunities on integration of fast charging infrastructure with grid. The economic aspects of fast charging infrastructure along with an overview of prospective areas for future research in this field are also presented.},
